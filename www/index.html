<p>I’m Bill Boyer, a software developer, architect and technical leader based in NYC. Most recently, I led software development for Viacom’s digital properties.</p>
<p>Right now, I’m getting hands-on experience with new web technologies, informally consulting for a few friends, and working on a couple of side projects that interest me &#8212; one of which is this site, a testbed that I'll use to reinforce my understanding of new tools, platforms and best practices.</p>
<p>Most of what I do here will be basic, and will borrow heavily from innumerable examples, docs, and other resources from all over the web.  I'll do my best to document everything I do, and include links to the resources I've found helpful.</p>
